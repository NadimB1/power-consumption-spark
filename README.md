# Real-Time Power Consumption Analysis System
## Project Description

This system provides real-time monitoring and analysis of power consumption data. It employs a full-stack solution using Python for backend processing and a dynamic HTML frontend for visualization. The system captures data, predicts power usage, and detects anomalies, leveraging advanced machine learning models.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Flask (for serving the data and running the backend)
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, TensorFlow (for machine learning models)
* HTML5, JavaScript (with Plotly.js for frontend visualizations)

## Installation

Install Python and the necessary libraries using pip:
```pip install flask pandas numpy plotly tensorflow```

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

## Running the System

Start the Flask server by running app_ai.py or app_v2.py:
```python app_ai.py```

Open your web browser and navigate to localhost:5000 to view the real-time dashboard.

# Usage
This system is designed for energy managers and environmental scientists to monitor and analyze power consumption in real-time. It provides insights into daily usage, predictive analytics, and anomaly detection.

# Outputs
Real-time power consumption charts
Predictive analytics for future consumption
Anomaly alerts if consumption deviates from expected patterns
